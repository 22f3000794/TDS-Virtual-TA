    "text": "Q: dear @carlton\nwhen will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?\nA: @23f2003413\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards",

The new error message will be clearer, like this:\nError: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: \"7.4\". Actual: 7.4\n\nFYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.",

Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?\nA: @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade.

    "text": "Q: @carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\nA: Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",
